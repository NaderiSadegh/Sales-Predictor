\chapter{Conclusion}


Accurately predicting sales amounts is essential for enterprises to maximize profits and avoid cash flow problems. To achieve this, it is crucial to develop precise forecasting models. Failure to do so can result in financial difficulties for organizations. As a result, building effective sales prediction models is a top priority. In this project, we evaluated the performance of various algorithms using a store sales dataset and analyzed the algorithm with the best performance. We found that the Decision Tree algorithm had the highest MSE value of 0.00061, while the XG Boost algorithm had the lowest MSE value of 0.00013. In terms of R2, the XG Boost algorithm had the highest value of 0.858, while the Decision Tree algorithm had the lowest value of 0.342. Therefore, our results suggest that the XG Boost algorithm is the most effective predictor for the dataset we analyzed, as it had the lowest MSE value and the highest R2 value.
